# Love2DMatch4Gravity : "Block Drop" Love2D Puyo Puyo Clone

![Gameplay Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Spex130/Love2DMatch4Gravity/master/githubcontent/gameplayscreenshot.png)

Created as an exercise on how to use the Love2D engine - meant to run on RetroPie using Love2D V.11. Controls are handled using an Ultimarc iPac 2, so controls are keyboard by default. USB Controllers are untested. The window allows for dynamic scaling, so should generally work in windowed mode just fine.

Default Controls:
  LCTRL   - Select/Spin
  LALT    - Back/Drop
  "1"     - Start
  ESC     - Hard Quit
  ARROWS  - Movement
